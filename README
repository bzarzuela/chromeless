Exploration work for the Chromeless Browser Project 

./examples = example of HTML code for browsers. At this stage we have some examples that may not entirely work. These are some use cases. 

Extension ( Jetpack ) 
===

This extension is part of initial experimentation. The first part of the investigation here is to workout many ways the Jetpack infra-structure can interact with content. So far we use existing or new tabs. We will move away from the traditional browser view later. 

To run:

+ Jetpack SDK 0.8+
+ Enter the ./extension/chromeless/ and run: cfx -a firefox -b path_to_your_firefox. If you are on Mac OSX, pass the path up to the Firefox.app ( do not put thelast slash / ). 

When the extension loads, the browser will be brought up and you can access the following URL: 

resource://-chromeless-data/first_browser/index.html

Notice also a line that is inserted at the bottom. This line was inserted from the Jetpack application code using page-mods. In this example we went so far: 

* Using local resource:// urls - files are stored in ./extension/chromeless/data/
* Using the page-mod module to intercept open pages and execute scripts in the context of the pages.
